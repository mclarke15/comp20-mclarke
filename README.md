COMP 20 Spring 2017 Private Repo for Meredith Clarke

What is this purpose of this Git repository?
The purpose of this Git repository is to show all the projects that I have done this semester and what I have learned, from building web applications to web security. 

What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite lab was the Epic Fail Lab, I feel like I had a really go understanding of javascript at that time and liked using this knowledge in a fun way. Also that Mariah Carey is a great song.

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have grown a decent amount, I think comp 20 has changed my perspective on the lack of structure that can be a part of computer science. This class has made me realize that I am not made for web programming because I need that structure, which has been a really useful realization. 

What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing I learned in this course was how to navigate all the resources that the internet has. Part of what helped me learn how to do this was learning the extensive terminology needed to properly communicate these issues to others. More specifically, going to the internet before going to a TA and how to read official documentation.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

Data and information vizualization!
